   <p class="course-info" >Computer Science Engineering (CSE) encompasses a variety of topics that relates to computation, 
like analysis of algorithms, programming languages, program design, software, and computer hardware.
Computer Science engineering has roots in electrical engineering, mathematics, and linguistics. CSE comprises of the basic knowledge of computer programming and networking. The computer science experience will give ample knowledge about the implementation design and management of the entire information system in both the aspects- hardware as well as software.</p>
<p class="course-info">In our college we offer B.tech Degree in Computer Science Engineering.
We have excellent faculties in the stream with more than a decade experience.
All the faculties are ex-IT proffesionalists.</p>

     <h2 id="elect"><u>ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING :</u></h2>
     
    <p class="course-info">Electrical engineering is an engineering discipline concerned with the study, design and 
application  of equipment, devices and systems which use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism.
It emerged as an identifiable occupation in the latter half of the 19th century after commercialization of
the electric telegraph, the telephone, and electrical power generation, distribution and use. Electrical engineering is one of the newer branches of engineering, and dates back to the late 19th century. It is the branch of engineering that deals with the technology of electricity. Electrical engineers work on a wide range of components, devices and systems, from tiny microchips to huge power station generators.</p>
<p class="course-info">In our college we offer B.tech in Electrical Engineering.
We have the best faculties at our Electrical Department with ample of experience.
All our faculties have industry experience.</p>

        <p class="course-info">Mechanical engineering is an engineering branch that combines engineering physics and mathematics 
principles with materials science to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems.
It is the branch of engineering that involves the design, production, and operation of machinery. Mechanical engineering is the study, design, development, construction, and testing of mechanical and thermal sensors and devices, including tools, engines, and machines.Mechanical engineers work mostly in engineering services, research and development, and manufacturing.</p>
<p class="course-info">In our College we offer B.tech in Mechanical Engineering.
We have the best faculties at our Mechanical Department.Our Department 
has recognition of Institute of Mechatronics.We have the best faculty.</p>
